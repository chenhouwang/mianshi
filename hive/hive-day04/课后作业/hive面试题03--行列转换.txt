现有一份以下格式的数据：
表示有id为1,2,3的学生选修了课程a,b,c,d,e,f中其中几门：

id course 
1,a
1,b
1,c
1,e
2,a
2,c
2,d
2,f
3,a
3,b
3,c
3,e


编写Hive的HQL语句来实现以下结果：
表中的1表示选修，表中的0表示未选修

id	a	b	c	d	e	f
1	1	1	1	0	1	0
2	1	0	1	1	0	1
3	1	1	1	0	1	0








解题思路：

1、创建表  导入数据

create database if not exists exercise;
use exercise;
drop table if exists exercise03;
create table if not exists exercise03(id int, course string) row format delimited fields terminated by ",";
truncate table exercise03;
load data local inpath "/home/hadoop/exercise03.txt" into table exercise03;
select * from exercise03;


结果：
1       a
1       b
1       c
1       e
2       a
2       c
2       d
2       f
3       a
3       b
3       c
3       e


2、先求出所有课程的集合

第一步：
select collect_set(course) as courses from exercise03;

结果：

["a","b","c","e","d","f"]



第二步：
set hive.strict.checks.cartesian.product=false;
set hive.exec.mode.local.auto=true;


create table course_tmp as 
select t1.id as id,t1.course as course,t2.course courses 
from 
(select id as id,collect_set(course) as course from exercise03 group by id ) t1 
join 
(select collect_set(course) as course from exercise03) t2;


结果：exercise03s表
id	course			courses
1       ["a","b","c","e"]       ["a","b","c","e","d","f"]
2       ["a","c","d","f"]       ["a","b","c","e","d","f"]
3       ["a","b","c","e"]       ["a","b","c","e","d","f"]


3、得出最终结果：
思路：
拿出course字段中的每一个元素在exercise03s中进行判断，看是否存在。

select id,
case when array_contains(course, courses[0]) then 1 else 0 end as a,
case when array_contains(course, courses[1]) then 1 else 0 end as b,
case when array_contains(course, courses[2]) then 1 else 0 end as c,
case when array_contains(course, courses[3]) then 1 else 0 end as d,
case when array_contains(course, courses[4]) then 1 else 0 end as e,
case when array_contains(course, courses[5]) then 1 else 0 end as f 
from course_tmp;

结果：
1       1       1       1       1       0       0
2       1       0       1       0       1       1
3       1       1       1       1       0       0





最终的完整的SQL：
select abc.id,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[0]) then 1 else 0 end as a,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[1]) then 1 else 0 end as b,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[2]) then 1 else 0 end as c,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[3]) then 1 else 0 end as d,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[4]) then 1 else 0 end as e,
case when array_contains(abc.course, abc.courses[5]) then 1 else 0 end as f 
from (
select t1.id as id,t1.course as course,t2.course courses 
from 
(select id as id,collect_set(course) as course from exercise03 group by id ) t1 
join 
(select collect_set(course) as course from exercise03) t2
) abc;
